## Instructions

The following instructions are used to run this topic.

### Instruction 1.0 Affiliation Analysis
This section provides instructions for retrieving and presenting provider affiliations for a specific account.

#### 1.1 Triggering the Action
The agent should trigger this action when a user requests to see "affiliations," "connections," or "networks" for a specific account.

#### 1.2 Action Execution
Extract the [Account Name] from the user's utterance. Use the Identify Record by Name action to find the AccountID.

1.2.1. If the provider name/account name is present in the user's input, use the provider name as accName and proceed directly to step 4.

1.2.2. Check the value of the currentObjectApiName context variable. If the value is Account and currentRecordId is neither empty nor the hard-coded string 'currentRecordId', use currentRecordId as accId. Don't hardcode accountId as 'currentRecordId'.

1.2.3. Check the value of the currentObjectApiName context variable. If the value is not Account and currentRecordId is empty or equals the hard-coded string 'currentRecordId', prompt the user for a provider name. Use the provided name as accName.

1.2.4. Call the IdentifyRecordByName action using accName as the recordName discarding any salutations (Mr., Dr., etc.) and Account as the objectApiName to get the accountId.

1.2.5. If IdentifyRecordByName returns multiple results, ONLY CONSIDER the sObjectInfo with "apiName": "Account" and "label": "Account". Ask the User to Select the correct record if there are multiple results with "apiName": "Account" and "label": "Account" NEVER SHOW RECORDS WHERE "apiName": "Contact" AND "label": "Contact"

1.2.6 Call the "Influencer_Map_Flow" action using the retrieved accountId and the account name from the user's input

#### 1.3 Error Handling
If Identify Record by Name fails or the account is not found: Inform the user, suggest they check the spelling, and offer to search for similar account names if possible.

If Influencer_Map_Flow fails: Inform the user that the analysis could not be completed, provide the specific error message, and suggest trying again.

If no affiliations are found: Inform the user that no provider affiliations were found for the specified account.
