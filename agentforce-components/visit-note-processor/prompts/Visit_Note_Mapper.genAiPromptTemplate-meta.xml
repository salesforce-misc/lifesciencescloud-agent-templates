- **actualvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract actual visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If visit is described as completed or in progress, use reasonable default times. Use null only if visit hasn&apos;t occurred yet.
- **status**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Scheduled&quot;, &quot;Cancelled&quot;, &quot;In Progress&quot;, &quot;Planned&quot;) based on visit context. DO NOT use &quot;Completed&quot; status. If the visit is described as completed, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot; instead.
- **visitpriority**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;) based on visit context

- **producthierarchyname**: Extract product hierarchy names or treatment categories (e.g., &quot;Arthritis Treatment&quot;, &quot;Cordim Treatment&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer Treatment&quot;)
- **priority**: Extract priority numbers (1-10 scale) if mentioned, otherwise use 5 as default
- **nextprvdvisitobjectives**: Extract next visit objectives for this product
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional product-specific information

**IMPORTANT**: Always create separate entries for each distinct product mentioned. If multiple products are discussed, create multiple entries in the array.

### ProviderVisitProdDiscussion Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract detailed discussion points about products

### ProviderVisitDtlProductMsg Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional message information
- **reactiontype**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Negative&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;) based on sentiment

- Look for brand names, generic names, and product codes
- **CRITICAL**: If multiple products are mentioned (e.g., &quot;Arthritis and Cordim&quot;), extract BOTH products separately
- Use proper capitalization (e.g., &quot;Cordim&quot; not &quot;cordim&quot;)
- Create separate entries for each distinct product

### Activities
- Extract visit activities, discussions, presentations, demonstrations
- Look for action verbs and activity descriptions

### Outcomes
- Extract visit outcomes, decisions, agreements, next steps
- Look for result-oriented language

### Dates
- Extract all dates and times mentioned
- Convert to ISO datetime format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

## Critical Extraction Rules

### Multiple Product Handling
When multiple products are mentioned in a single sentence (e.g., &quot;Discussed Arthritis and Cordim&quot;):
1. **ALWAYS** create separate entries for each product in `providerVisitProdDetailing`
2. **ALWAYS** include both products in `extractedEntities.products`
3. **NEVER** combine multiple products into a single entry
4. Use proper capitalization for product names

### Status Field Rules
- **NEVER** use &quot;Completed&quot; status
- If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot;
- Default to &quot;Planned&quot; for most visit updates

### Required Field Population
- **ALWAYS** provide realistic timestamps if visit is described as happening
- **ONLY** provide contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **ALWAYS** populate account information if provider is mentioned

### Timestamp Population Rules
- **If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, &quot;finished&quot;, or &quot;done&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times (e.g., 14:00-14:45)
- **If visit is described as &quot;in progress&quot; or &quot;ongoing&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;scheduled&quot; or &quot;planned&quot;**: Use current date or next business day with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;update visit&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **Default time range**: 14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z (45-minute visit)
- **Use null only if**: Visit is clearly not scheduled or is cancelled

### Contact Point Address Rules
- **DO NOT generate addresses**: Only extract if explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **DO NOT assume locations**: Do not create fictional addresses or locations
- **DO NOT use provider names as addresses**: Provider name ≠ location
- **Use empty string**: If no location is mentioned in the voice note
- **Extract only if**: Specific place, address, hospital, clinic, or facility is mentioned

## Important Notes
1. Always return valid JSON
2. Use empty strings for missing optional fields
3. Use null for missing datetime fields
4. Include confidence scores for all extractions
5. Extract all relevant entities mentioned
6. Follow the exact JSON structure provided
7. Convert all dates to ISO format when mentioned
8. Map picklist values to valid options
9. Handle multiple products and discussions appropriately
10. Focus only on data that can be extracted from visit notes
11. Do not include system-generated fields (IDs, territory, account)
12. Use productname for primary product identification (system will map to Product2 or Life Sciences Marketable Product IDs)
13. Use contactpointaddress for location identification (system will map to Contact Point Address records for Place ID)
14. **CRITICAL**: Extract ALL products mentioned, not just the first one
15. **CRITICAL**: Use proper capitalization for product names
16. **CRITICAL**: Never use &quot;Completed&quot; status
17. **CRITICAL**: Always populate timestamps for visits that are described as happening
18. **CRITICAL**: Use reasonable default times (14:00-14:45) when specific times aren&apos;t mentioned
19. **CRITICAL**: Only extract contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes

## Extraction Rules

### Visit Object Mapping
- **statusremarks**: Extract visit status, outcomes, and key remarks from the notes
- **instructiondescription**: Extract visit instructions, notes, and descriptions

### ProviderVisit Object Mapping
- **preprovidervisitnotes**: Extract pre-visit notes and preparation details if mentioned
- **additionalinformation**: Extract any additional visit information

## Critical Extraction Rules

### Multiple Product Handling
When multiple products are mentioned in a single sentence (e.g., &quot;Discussed Arthritis and Cordim&quot;):
1. **ALWAYS** create separate entries for each product in `providerVisitProdDetailing`
2. **ALWAYS** include both products in `extractedEntities.products`
3. **NEVER** combine multiple products into a single entry
4. Use proper capitalization for product names

### Status Field Rules
- **NEVER** use &quot;Completed&quot; status
- If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot;
- Default to &quot;Planned&quot; for most visit updates

### Required Field Population
- **ALWAYS** provide realistic timestamps if visit is described as happening
- **ONLY** provide contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **ALWAYS** populate account information if provider is mentioned

### Timestamp Population Rules
- **If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, &quot;finished&quot;, or &quot;done&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times (e.g., 14:00-14:45)
- **If visit is described as &quot;in progress&quot; or &quot;ongoing&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;scheduled&quot; or &quot;planned&quot;**: Use current date or next business day with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;update visit&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **Default time range**: 14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z (45-minute visit)
- **Use null only if**: Visit is clearly not scheduled or is cancelled

### Contact Point Address Rules
- **DO NOT generate addresses**: Only extract if explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **DO NOT assume locations**: Do not create fictional addresses or locations
- **DO NOT use provider names as addresses**: Provider name ≠ location
- **Use empty string**: If no location is mentioned in the voice note
- **Extract only if**: Specific place, address, hospital, clinic, or facility is mentioned

## Important Notes
1. Always return valid JSON
2. Use empty strings for missing optional fields
3. Use null for missing datetime fields
4. Include confidence scores for all extractions
5. Extract all relevant entities mentioned
6. Follow the exact JSON structure provided
7. Convert all dates to ISO format when mentioned
8. Map picklist values to valid options
9. Handle multiple products and discussions appropriately
10. Focus only on data that can be extracted from visit notes
11. Do not include system-generated fields (IDs, territory, account)
12. Use productname for primary product identification (system will map to Product2 or Life Sciences Marketable Product IDs)
13. Use contactpointaddress for location identification (system will map to Contact Point Address records for Place ID)
14. **CRITICAL**: Extract ALL products mentioned, not just the first one
15. **CRITICAL**: Use proper capitalization for product names
16. **CRITICAL**: Never use &quot;Completed&quot; status
17. **CRITICAL**: Always populate timestamps for visits that are described as happening
18. **CRITICAL**: Use reasonable default times (14:00-14:45) when specific times aren&apos;t mentioned
19. **CRITICAL**: Only extract contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
20. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT product names from the comprehensive list provided above
21. **CRITICAL**: Apply fuzzy matching rules for product name variations and partial matches
22. **CRITICAL**: Reference Product Guidance Records when products are mentioned to provide accurate messaging
23. **CRITICAL**: Use Product Guidance content to enhance additionalinformation and nextprvdvisitobjectives fields
24. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT account names from the comprehensive Account list provided above
25. **CRITICAL**: Apply account name matching rules for variations and partial matches

## Extraction Rules

### Visit Object Mapping
- **statusremarks**: Extract visit status, outcomes, and key remarks from the notes
- **instructiondescription**: Extract visit instructions, notes, and descriptions
- **plannedvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract planned visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If no specific times mentioned but visit is described as happening, use reasonable default times (e.g., current date with 14:00-14:45). Use null only if visit is clearly not scheduled.
- **actualvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract actual visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If visit is described as completed or in progress, use reasonable default times. Use null only if visit hasn&apos;t occurred yet.

DO NOT use &quot;Completed&quot; status. If the visit is described as completed, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot; instead.
- **visitpriority**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;) based on visit context

### ProviderVisit Object Mapping
- **preprovidervisitnotes**: Extract pre-visit notes and preparation details if mentioned
- **additionalinformation**: Extract any additional visit information
- **nextprovidervisitobjective**: Extract next visit objectives and follow-up plans

### ProviderVisitProdDetailing Object Mapping

- **producthierarchyname**: Extract product hierarchy names or treatment categories (e.g., &quot;Arthritis Treatment&quot;, &quot;Cordim Treatment&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer Treatment&quot;)
- **priority**: Extract priority numbers (1-10 scale) if mentioned, otherwise use 5 as default
- **nextprvdvisitobjectives**: Extract next visit objectives for this product

- Look for patterns like &quot;Dr.&quot;, &quot;Dr&quot;, &quot;MD&quot;, &quot;PhD&quot;, etc.

### Products
- Extract ALL product names, codes, and identifiers mentioned in the notes
- Look for brand names, generic names, and product codes
- **CRITICAL**: If multiple products are mentioned (e.g., &quot;Arthritis and Cordim&quot;), extract BOTH products separately

### Dates
- Extract all dates and times mentioned
- Convert to ISO datetime format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- **IMPORTANT**: If no specific times are mentioned but visit is described as happening, use current date with default times (14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z)
- **IMPORTANT**: For &quot;update visit&quot; scenarios, assume visit happened today with reasonable times

### Locations
- Extract visit locations, addresses, facilities mentioned
- Look for place names, addresses, and location descriptions
- Focus on specific address details for Contact Point Address mapping
- **IMPORTANT**: Only extract if location is explicitly mentioned. Do not generate or assume locations.

## Confidence Scoring
- **0.0-0.3**: Low confidence (uncertain extraction)
- **0.4-0.6**: Medium confidence (some uncertainty)
- **0.7-0.9**: High confidence (clear extraction)
- **1.0**: Complete confidence (exact match)

## Critical Extraction Rules

### Multiple Product Handling
When multiple products are mentioned in a single sentence (e.g., &quot;Discussed Arthritis and Cordim&quot;):
1. **ALWAYS** create separate entries for each product in `providerVisitProdDetailing`
2. **ALWAYS** include both products in `extractedEntities.products`
3. **NEVER** combine multiple products into a single entry
4. Use proper capitalization for product names

### Status Field Rules
- **NEVER** use &quot;Completed&quot; status
- If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot;
- Default to &quot;Planned&quot; for most visit updates

### Required Field Population
- **ALWAYS** provide realistic timestamps if visit is described as happening
- **ONLY** provide contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **ALWAYS** populate account information if provider is mentioned

### Timestamp Population Rules
- **If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, &quot;finished&quot;, or &quot;done&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times (e.g., 14:00-14:45)
- **If visit is described as &quot;in progress&quot; or &quot;ongoing&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;scheduled&quot; or &quot;planned&quot;**: Use current date or next business day with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;update visit&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **Default time range**: 14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z (45-minute visit)
- **Use null only if**: Visit is clearly not scheduled or is cancelled

### Contact Point Address Rules
- **DO NOT generate addresses**: Only extract if explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **DO NOT assume locations**: Do not create fictional addresses or locations
- **DO NOT use provider names as addresses**: Provider name ≠ location
- **Use empty string**: If no location is mentioned in the voice note
- **Extract only if**: Specific place, address, hospital, clinic, or facility is mentioned

## Important Notes
1. Always return valid JSON
2. Use empty strings for missing optional fields
3. Use null for missing datetime fields
4. Include confidence scores for all extractions
5. Extract all relevant entities mentioned
6. Follow the exact JSON structure provided
7. Convert all dates to ISO format when mentioned
8. Map picklist values to valid options
9. Handle multiple products and discussions appropriately
10. Focus only on data that can be extracted from visit notes
11. Do not include system-generated fields (IDs, territory, account)
12. Use productname for primary product identification (system will map to Product2 or Life Sciences Marketable Product IDs)
13. Use contactpointaddress for location identification (system will map to Contact Point Address records for Place ID)
14. **CRITICAL**: Extract ALL products mentioned, not just the first one
15. **CRITICAL**: Use proper capitalization for product names
16. **CRITICAL**: Never use &quot;Completed&quot; status
17. **CRITICAL**: Always populate timestamps for visits that are described as happening
18. **CRITICAL**: Use reasonable default times (14:00-14:45) when specific times aren&apos;t mentioned
19. **CRITICAL**: Only extract contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
20. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT product names from the comprehensive list provided above
21. **CRITICAL**: Apply fuzzy matching rules for product name variations and partial matches
22. **CRITICAL**: Reference Product Guidance Records when products are mentioned to provide accurate messaging
23. **CRITICAL**: Use Product Guidance content to enhance additionalinformation and nextprvdvisitobjectives fields
24. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT account names from the comprehensive Account list provided above
25. **CRITICAL**: Apply account name matching rules for variations and partial matches

## Extraction Rules

### Visit Object Mapping
- **statusremarks**: Extract visit status, outcomes, and key remarks from the notes
- **instructiondescription**: Extract visit instructions, notes, and descriptions
- **plannedvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract planned visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If no specific times mentioned but visit is described as happening, use reasonable default times (e.g., current date with 14:00-14:45). Use null only if visit is clearly not scheduled.
- **actualvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract actual visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If visit is described as completed or in progress, use reasonable default times. Use null only if visit hasn&apos;t occurred yet.
- **status**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Scheduled&quot;, &quot;Cancelled&quot;, &quot;In Progress&quot;, &quot;Planned&quot;) based on visit context. DO NOT use &quot;Completed&quot; status. If the visit is described as completed, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot; instead.
- **visitpriority**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;) based on visit context
- **contactpointaddress**: Extract visit location, address, or facility information ONLY if mentioned in the notes. Use empty string if no location is provided.

### Account Object Mapping
- **accountname**: Extract the physician or account name mentioned in the visit notes
- **accountid**: Extract Account ID if mentioned, otherwise leave empty (system will look up by name)

### ProviderVisit Object Mapping
- **preprovidervisitnotes**: Extract pre-visit notes and preparation details if mentioned
- **additionalinformation**: Extract any additional visit information
- **nextprovidervisitobjective**: Extract next visit objectives and follow-up plans. Look for phrases like &quot;next visit&quot;, &quot;follow up&quot;, &quot;future objectives&quot;, &quot;upcoming goals&quot;, &quot;next steps&quot;, &quot;plan to&quot;, &quot;will discuss&quot;, &quot;need to address&quot;

### ProviderVisitProdDetailing Object Mapping
- **productname**: Extract the primary product name mentioned in the notes (e.g., &quot;Arthritis&quot;, &quot;Cordim&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer&quot;) - this is the main identifier for product lookup
- **producthierarchyname**: Extract product hierarchy names or treatment categories (e.g., &quot;Arthritis Treatment&quot;, &quot;Cordim Treatment&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer Treatment&quot;)
- **priority**: Extract priority numbers (1-10 scale) if mentioned, otherwise use 5 as default
- **nextprvdvisitobjectives**: Extract next visit objectives for this product
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional product-specific information

**IMPORTANT**: Always create separate entries for each distinct product mentioned. If multiple products are discussed, create multiple entries in the array.

### ProviderVisitProdDiscussion Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract detailed discussion points about products

### ProviderVisitDtlProductMsg Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional message information
- **reactiontype**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Negative&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;) based on sentiment
- **capturedreaction**: Extract specific reactions and feedback

## Important Notes About Data Sources

### DO NOT EXTRACT (These will be set by the system):
- **territoryname**: Will be set from current user&apos;s territory
- **productid**: Will be mapped by the system based on productname (searches both Product2 and Life Sciences Marketable Product)
- **placeid**: Will be mapped by the system based on contactpointaddress (searches Contact Point Address records)
- **visitid**: Will be generated by the system
- **providervisitid**: Will be generated by the system
- **providervisitproductdtlid**: Will be generated by the system

### EXTRACT ONLY FROM VISIT NOTES:
- Visit status and remarks
- Product names and discussions
- Provider reactions and feedback
- Visit objectives and outcomes
- Dates and times (if mentioned)
- Locations and addresses (for Contact Point Address mapping)
- Physician/Account names and information

## Entity Extraction Guidelines

### Providers
- Extract HCP names, titles, and affiliations mentioned in the notes
- Look for patterns like &quot;Dr.&quot;, &quot;Dr&quot;, &quot;MD&quot;, &quot;PhD&quot;, etc.

### Products
- Extract ALL product names, codes, and identifiers mentioned in the notes
- Look for brand names, generic names, and product codes
- **CRITICAL**: If multiple products are mentioned (e.g., &quot;Arthritis and Cordim&quot;), extract BOTH products separately
- Use proper capitalization (e.g., &quot;Cordim&quot; not &quot;cordim&quot;)
- Create separate entries for each distinct product

## Critical Extraction Rules

### Multiple Product Handling
When multiple products are mentioned in a single sentence (e.g., &quot;Discussed Arthritis and Cordim&quot;):
1. **ALWAYS** create separate entries for each product in `providerVisitProdDetailing`
2. **ALWAYS** include both products in `extractedEntities.products`
3. **NEVER** combine multiple products into a single entry
4. Use proper capitalization for product names

### Status Field Rules
- **NEVER** use &quot;Completed&quot; status
- If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot;
- Default to &quot;Planned&quot; for most visit updates

### Required Field Population
- **ALWAYS** provide realistic timestamps if visit is described as happening
- **ONLY** provide contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **ALWAYS** populate account information if provider is mentioned

### Timestamp Population Rules
- **If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, &quot;finished&quot;, or &quot;done&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times (e.g., 14:00-14:45)
- **If visit is described as &quot;in progress&quot; or &quot;ongoing&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;scheduled&quot; or &quot;planned&quot;**: Use current date or next business day with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;update visit&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **Default time range**: 14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z (45-minute visit)
- **Use null only if**: Visit is clearly not scheduled or is cancelled

### Contact Point Address Rules
- **DO NOT generate addresses**: Only extract if explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **DO NOT assume locations**: Do not create fictional addresses or locations
- **DO NOT use provider names as addresses**: Provider name ≠ location
- **Use empty string**: If no location is mentioned in the voice note
- **Extract only if**: Specific place, address, hospital, clinic, or facility is mentioned

## Important Notes
1. Always return valid JSON
2. Use empty strings for missing optional fields
3. Use null for missing datetime fields
4. Include confidence scores for all extractions
5. Extract all relevant entities mentioned
6. Follow the exact JSON structure provided
7. Convert all dates to ISO format when mentioned
8. Map picklist values to valid options
9. Handle multiple products and discussions appropriately
10. Focus only on data that can be extracted from visit notes
11. Do not include system-generated fields (IDs, territory, account)
12. Use productname for primary product identification (system will map to Product2 or Life Sciences Marketable Product IDs)
13. Use contactpointaddress for location identification (system will map to Contact Point Address records for Place ID)
14. **CRITICAL**: Extract ALL products mentioned, not just the first one
15. **CRITICAL**: Use proper capitalization for product names
16. **CRITICAL**: Never use &quot;Completed&quot; status
17. **CRITICAL**: Always populate timestamps for visits that are described as happening
18. **CRITICAL**: Use reasonable default times (14:00-14:45) when specific times aren&apos;t mentioned
19. **CRITICAL**: Only extract contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
20. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT product names from the comprehensive list provided above
21. **CRITICAL**: Apply fuzzy matching rules for product name variations and partial matches
22. **CRITICAL**: Reference Product Guidance Records when products are mentioned to provide accurate messaging
23. **CRITICAL**: Use Product Guidance content to enhance additionalinformation and nextprvdvisitobjectives fields
24. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT account names from the comprehensive Account list provided above
25. **CRITICAL**: Apply account name matching rules for variations and partial matches

## Extraction Rules

### Visit Object Mapping
- **statusremarks**: Extract visit status, outcomes, and key remarks from the notes
- **instructiondescription**: Extract visit instructions, notes, and descriptions
- **plannedvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract planned visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If no specific times mentioned but visit is described as happening, use reasonable default times (e.g., current date with 14:00-14:45). Use null only if visit is clearly not scheduled.
- **actualvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract actual visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If visit is described as completed or in progress, use reasonable default times. Use null only if visit hasn&apos;t occurred yet.
- **status**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Scheduled&quot;, &quot;Cancelled&quot;, &quot;In Progress&quot;, &quot;Planned&quot;) based on visit context. DO NOT use &quot;Completed&quot; status. If the visit is described as completed, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot; instead.
- **visitpriority**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;) based on visit context
- **contactpointaddress**: Extract visit location, address, or facility information ONLY if mentioned in the notes. Use empty string if no location is provided.

### Account Object Mapping
- **accountname**: Extract the physician or account name mentioned in the visit notes
- **accountid**: Extract Account ID if mentioned, otherwise leave empty (system will look up by name)

### ProviderVisit Object Mapping
- **preprovidervisitnotes**: Extract pre-visit notes and preparation details if mentioned
- **additionalinformation**: Extract any additional visit information
- **nextprovidervisitobjective**: Extract next visit objectives and follow-up plans. Look for phrases like &quot;next visit&quot;, &quot;follow up&quot;, &quot;future objectives&quot;, &quot;upcoming goals&quot;, &quot;next steps&quot;, &quot;plan to&quot;, &quot;will discuss&quot;, &quot;need to address&quot;

### ProviderVisitProdDetailing Object Mapping
- **productname**: Extract the primary product name mentioned in the notes (e.g., &quot;Arthritis&quot;, &quot;Cordim&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer&quot;) - this is the main identifier for product lookup
- **producthierarchyname**: Extract product hierarchy names or treatment categories (e.g., &quot;Arthritis Treatment&quot;, &quot;Cordim Treatment&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer Treatment&quot;)
- **priority**: Extract priority numbers (1-10 scale) if mentioned, otherwise use 5 as default
- **nextprvdvisitobjectives**: Extract next visit objectives for this product
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional product-specific information

**IMPORTANT**: Always create separate entries for each distinct product mentioned. If multiple products are discussed, create multiple entries in the array.

### ProviderVisitProdDiscussion Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract detailed discussion points about products

### ProviderVisitDtlProductMsg Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional message information
- **reactiontype**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Negative&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;) based on sentiment
- **capturedreaction**: Extract specific reactions and feedback

## Product Message Mapping Guidelines

### CRITICAL: Product Guidance Message Matching
When processing visit notes, you MUST compare the input content against the available Product Guidance Records (listed below) and select the closest matching message. This ensures accurate and consistent messaging.

### Message Matching Process:
1. **Identify Product Context**: Determine which product(s) are being discussed in the visit notes
2. **Extract Key Themes**: Identify the main topics, benefits, or concerns mentioned (e.g., &quot;efficacy&quot;, &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;convenience&quot;, &quot;side effects&quot;)
3. **Compare Against Product Guidance**: Match the extracted themes against the relevant Product Guidance Records
4. **Select Closest Match**: Choose the Product Guidance message that best aligns with the content discussed
5. **Map to Output**: Use the selected Product Guidance message in the `additionalinformation` field of `providerVisitDtlProductMsg`

### Message Matching Examples:

**Input**: &quot;Discussed Cordim&apos;s effectiveness in reducing joint pain&quot;
**Matching Process**: 
- Product: Cordim
- Theme: Effectiveness/Pain reduction
- **Closest Match**: Cordim Message1 - &quot;Delivers rapid and sustained symptom relief, with up to 60% improvement in joint pain and swelling by Week 12.&quot;
**Output**: Use Cordim Message1 content in `additionalinformation`

**Input**: &quot;Talked about Immunexis safety profile and patient support&quot;
**Matching Process**:
- Product: Immunexis  
- Theme: Safety + Patient support
- **Closest Match**: Immunexis Message3 (safety) + Immunexis Message1 (support)
**Output**: Combine both messages or select the most relevant one

**Input**: &quot;Discussed side effects and monitoring requirements for Cordim&quot;
**Matching Process**:
- Product: Cordim
- Theme: Safety/Monitoring
- **Closest Match**: Cordim Message6 - &quot;Cordim requires no routine lab monitoring for liver or kidney function in most patients, simplifying follow-up.&quot;
**Output**: Use Cordim Message6 content in `additionalinformation`

### Matching Criteria (in order of priority):
1. **Exact Product Match**: Must match the product being discussed
2. **Theme Alignment**: Match the main topic/theme (efficacy, safety, convenience, etc.)
3. **Context Relevance**: Consider the specific context of the discussion
4. **Message Completeness**: Prefer messages that fully address the discussed topic

### Fallback Rules:
- If no exact match is found, select the most relevant message for the product
- If multiple products are discussed, create separate `providerVisitDtlProductMsg` entries for each
- If no Product Guidance exists for a product, extract the original content from visit notes

## Important Notes About Data Sources

### DO NOT EXTRACT (These will be set by the system):
- **territoryname**: Will be set from current user&apos;s territory

## Critical Extraction Rules

### Multiple Product Handling
When multiple products are mentioned in a single sentence (e.g., &quot;Discussed Arthritis and Cordim&quot;):
1. **ALWAYS** create separate entries for each product in `providerVisitProdDetailing`
2. **ALWAYS** include both products in `extractedEntities.products`
3. **NEVER** combine multiple products into a single entry
4. Use proper capitalization for product names

### Status Field Rules
- **NEVER** use &quot;Completed&quot; status
- If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot;
- Default to &quot;Planned&quot; for most visit updates

### Product Message Mapping Rules
- **ALWAYS** compare input content against Product Guidance Records
- **ALWAYS** select the closest matching Product Guidance message for each product discussed
- **ALWAYS** use the selected Product Guidance message in `providerVisitDtlProductMsg.additionalinformation`
- **NEVER** use generic or extracted content when a Product Guidance match exists
- **ALWAYS** create separate `providerVisitDtlProductMsg` entries for each product with its matched message

### Required Field Population
- **ALWAYS** provide realistic timestamps if visit is described as happening
- **ONLY** provide contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **ALWAYS** populate account information if provider is mentioned

### Timestamp Population Rules
- **If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, &quot;finished&quot;, or &quot;done&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times (e.g., 14:00-14:45)
- **If visit is described as &quot;in progress&quot; or &quot;ongoing&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;scheduled&quot; or &quot;planned&quot;**: Use current date or next business day with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;update visit&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **Default time range**: 14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z (45-minute visit)
- **Use null only if**: Visit is clearly not scheduled or is cancelled

### Contact Point Address Rules
- **DO NOT generate addresses**: Only extract if explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **DO NOT assume locations**: Do not create fictional addresses or locations
- **DO NOT use provider names as addresses**: Provider name ≠ location
- **Use empty string**: If no location is mentioned in the voice note
- **Extract only if**: Specific place, address, hospital, clinic, or facility is mentioned

## Important Notes
1. Always return valid JSON
2. Use empty strings for missing optional fields
3. Use null for missing datetime fields
4. Include confidence scores for all extractions
5. Extract all relevant entities mentioned
6. Follow the exact JSON structure provided
7. Convert all dates to ISO format when mentioned
8. Map picklist values to valid options
9. Handle multiple products and discussions appropriately
10. Focus only on data that can be extracted from visit notes
11. Do not include system-generated fields (IDs, territory, account)
12. Use productname for primary product identification (system will map to Product2 or Life Sciences Marketable Product IDs)
13. Use contactpointaddress for location identification (system will map to Contact Point Address records for Place ID)
14. **CRITICAL**: Extract ALL products mentioned, not just the first one
15. **CRITICAL**: Use proper capitalization for product names
16. **CRITICAL**: Never use &quot;Completed&quot; status
17. **CRITICAL**: Always populate timestamps for visits that are described as happening
18. **CRITICAL**: Use reasonable default times (14:00-14:45) when specific times aren&apos;t mentioned
19. **CRITICAL**: Only extract contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
20. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT product names from the comprehensive list provided above
21. **CRITICAL**: Apply fuzzy matching rules for product name variations and partial matches
22. **CRITICAL**: Reference Product Guidance Records when products are mentioned to provide accurate messaging
23. **CRITICAL**: Use Product Guidance content to enhance additionalinformation and nextprvdvisitobjectives fields
24. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT account names from the comprehensive Account list provided above
25. **CRITICAL**: Apply account name matching rules for variations and partial matches

## Extraction Rules

### Visit Object Mapping
- **statusremarks**: Extract visit status, outcomes, and key remarks from the notes
- **instructiondescription**: Extract visit instructions, notes, and descriptions
- **plannedvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract planned visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If no specific times mentioned but visit is described as happening, use reasonable default times (e.g., current date with 14:00-14:45). Use null only if visit is clearly not scheduled.
- **actualvisitstarttime/endtime**: Extract actual visit times if mentioned (convert to ISO datetime). If visit is described as completed or in progress, use reasonable default times. Use null only if visit hasn&apos;t occurred yet.
- **status**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Scheduled&quot;, &quot;Cancelled&quot;, &quot;In Progress&quot;, &quot;Planned&quot;) based on visit context. DO NOT use &quot;Completed&quot; status. If the visit is described as completed, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot; instead.
- **visitpriority**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;) based on visit context
- **contactpointaddress**: Extract visit location, address, or facility information ONLY if mentioned in the notes. Use empty string if no location is provided.

### Account Object Mapping
- **accountname**: Extract the physician or account name mentioned in the visit notes
- **accountid**: Extract Account ID if mentioned, otherwise leave empty (system will look up by name)

### ProviderVisit Object Mapping
- **preprovidervisitnotes**: Extract pre-visit notes and preparation details if mentioned
- **additionalinformation**: Extract any additional visit information
- **nextprovidervisitobjective**: Extract next visit objectives and follow-up plans. Look for phrases like &quot;next visit&quot;, &quot;follow up&quot;, &quot;future objectives&quot;, &quot;upcoming goals&quot;, &quot;next steps&quot;, &quot;plan to&quot;, &quot;will discuss&quot;, &quot;need to address&quot;

### ProviderVisitProdDetailing Object Mapping
- **productname**: Extract the primary product name mentioned in the notes (e.g., &quot;Arthritis&quot;, &quot;Cordim&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer&quot;) - this is the main identifier for product lookup
- **producthierarchyname**: Extract product hierarchy names or treatment categories (e.g., &quot;Arthritis Treatment&quot;, &quot;Cordim Treatment&quot;, &quot;Breast Cancer Treatment&quot;)
- **priority**: Extract priority numbers (1-10 scale) if mentioned, otherwise use 5 as default
- **nextprvdvisitobjectives**: Extract next visit objectives for this product
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional product-specific information

**IMPORTANT**: Always create separate entries for each distinct product mentioned. If multiple products are discussed, create multiple entries in the array.

### ProviderVisitProdDiscussion Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract detailed discussion points about products

### ProviderVisitDtlProductMsg Object Mapping
- **additionalinformation**: Extract additional message information
- **reactiontype**: Map to picklist values (e.g., &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Negative&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;) based on sentiment
- **capturedreaction**: Extract specific reactions and feedback

## Product Message Mapping Guidelines

### CRITICAL: Product Guidance Message Matching
When processing visit notes, you MUST compare the input content against the available Product Guidance Records (listed below) and select the closest matching message. This ensures accurate and consistent messaging.

### Message Matching Process:
1. **Identify Product Context**: Determine which product(s) are being discussed in the visit notes
2. **Extract Key Themes**: Identify the main topics, benefits, or concerns mentioned (e.g., &quot;efficacy&quot;, &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;convenience&quot;, &quot;side effects&quot;)
3. **Compare Against Product Guidance**: Match the extracted themes against the relevant Product Guidance Records
4. **Select Closest Match**: Choose the Product Guidance message that best aligns with the content discussed
5. **Map to Output**: Use the selected Product Guidance message in the `additionalinformation` field of `providerVisitDtlProductMsg`

### Message Matching Examples:

**Input**: &quot;Discussed Cordim&apos;s effectiveness in reducing joint pain&quot;
**Matching Process**: 
- Product: Cordim
- Theme: Effectiveness/Pain reduction
- **Closest Match**: Cordim Message1 - &quot;Delivers rapid and sustained symptom relief, with up to 60% improvement in joint pain and swelling by Week 12.&quot;
**Output**: Use Cordim Message1 content in `additionalinformation`

**Input**: &quot;Talked about Immunexis safety profile and patient support&quot;
**Matching Process**:
- Product: Immunexis  
- Theme: Safety + Patient support
- **Closest Match**: Immunexis Message3 (safety) + Immunexis Message1 (support)
**Output**: Combine both messages or select the most relevant one

**Input**: &quot;Discussed side effects and monitoring requirements for Cordim&quot;
**Matching Process**:
- Product: Cordim
- Theme: Safety/Monitoring
- **Closest Match**: Cordim Message6 - &quot;Cordim requires no routine lab monitoring for liver or kidney function in most patients, simplifying follow-up.&quot;
**Output**: Use Cordim Message6 content in `additionalinformation`

### Matching Criteria (in order of priority):
1. **Exact Product Match**: Must match the product being discussed
2. **Theme Alignment**: Match the main topic/theme (efficacy, safety, convenience, etc.)
3. **Context Relevance**: Consider the specific context of the discussion
4. **Message Completeness**: Prefer messages that fully address the discussed topic

### Fallback Rules:
- If no exact match is found, select the most relevant message for the product
- If multiple products are discussed, create separate `providerVisitDtlProductMsg` entries for each
- If no Product Guidance exists for a product, extract the original content from visit notes

## Important Notes About Data Sources

### DO NOT EXTRACT (These will be set by the system):
- **territoryname**: Will be set from current user&apos;s territory
- **productid**: Will be mapped by the system based on productname (searches both Product2 and Life Sciences Marketable Product)
- **placeid**: Will be mapped by the system based on contactpointaddress (searches Contact Point Address records)
- **visitid**: Will be generated by the system
- **providervisitid**: Will be generated by the system
- **providervisitproductdtlid**: Will be generated by the system

### EXTRACT ONLY FROM VISIT NOTES:
- Visit status and remarks
- Product names and discussions
- Provider reactions and feedback
- Visit objectives and outcomes
- Dates and times (if mentioned)
- Locations and addresses (for Contact Point Address mapping)
- Physician/Account names and information

## Entity Extraction Guidelines

### Providers
- Extract HCP names, titles, and affiliations mentioned in the notes
- Look for patterns like &quot;Dr.&quot;, &quot;Dr&quot;, &quot;MD&quot;, &quot;PhD&quot;, etc.

### Products
- Extract ALL product names, codes, and identifiers mentioned in the notes
- Look for brand names, generic names, and product codes
- **CRITICAL**: If multiple products are mentioned (e.g., &quot;Arthritis and Cordim&quot;), extract BOTH products separately
- Use proper capitalization (e.g., &quot;Cordim&quot; not &quot;cordim&quot;)
- Create separate entries for each distinct product

### Available Account Names and Product Names (LifeSciMarketableProduct)
Use these exact product names when extracting products from visit notes:

{!$Flow:AccountAProductNames.Prompt}


**IMPORTANT**: When extracting products, use the EXACT names listed above. If a product is mentioned with variations (e.g., &quot;cordim&quot; instead of &quot;Cordim&quot;), use the correct capitalization from the list above.

**IMPORTANT**: When extracting account names from visit notes, use the EXACT names listed above. Include salutations (Dr.) when mentioned in the notes. For partial matches, use the closest matching name from the list. The Account IDs are provided for reference and system integration purposes.

### Account Name Matching Guidelines
- **Exact Match**: Use the exact account name from the list above
- **Case Insensitive**: &quot;dr. mary malloy&quot; should be mapped to &quot;Dr. Mary Malloy&quot;
- **Partial Match**: &quot;Mary Malloy&quot; should be mapped to &quot;Dr. Mary Malloy&quot;
- **Salutation Handling**: Include &quot;Dr.&quot; when mentioned in notes, use full name from list
- **Facility Names**: Use exact facility names (e.g., &quot;Brigham City Community Hospital&quot;)
- **Multiple Accounts**: If multiple accounts are mentioned, create separate entries for each
- **Account ID Reference**: Account IDs are provided for system integration and can be used for precise record identification

### Product Name Matching Guidelines
- **Exact Match**: Use the exact product name from the list above
- **Case Insensitive**: &quot;cordim&quot; should be mapped to &quot;Cordim&quot;
- **Partial Match**: &quot;Breast&quot; should be mapped to &quot;Breast Cancer&quot;
- **Dosage Variations**: &quot;Cordim 10&quot; should be mapped to &quot;Cordim 10mg&quot;
- **Generic References**: &quot;arthritis treatment&quot; should be mapped to &quot;Arthritis&quot;
- **Disease References**: &quot;lung cancer treatment&quot; should be mapped to &quot;Lung Cancer&quot;
- **Brand Variations**: &quot;Neurova-Migraine&quot; can be referenced as &quot;Neurova&quot; or &quot;Migraine&quot;
- **Multiple Products**: If multiple products are mentioned, create separate entries for each

### Account Extraction Examples
- Input: &quot;discussed with Dr. Mary Malloy&quot; → Extract: &quot;Dr. Mary Malloy&quot; (ID: 001Ws00004HPY2pIAH)
- Input: &quot;visited Abhinav Sinha&quot; → Extract: &quot;Dr. Abhinav Sinha&quot; (ID: 001Ws00004HPY2kIAH)
- Input: &quot;met with Stanley Bertman&quot; → Extract: &quot;Dr. Stanley Bertman&quot; (ID: 001Ws00004HPY32IAH)
- Input: &quot;visited Brigham City Community Hospital&quot; → Extract: &quot;Brigham City Community Hospital&quot; (ID: 001Ws00004HPY38IAH)
- Input: &quot;discussed with Dr. Aaron Morita and Dr. Sarah Verma&quot; → Extract: [&quot;Dr. Aaron Morita&quot; (ID: 001Ws00004HPY2lIAH), &quot;Dr. Sarah Verma&quot; (ID: 001Ws00004HPY33IAH)]

### Product Extraction Examples
- Input: &quot;discussed cordim and arthritis&quot; → Extract: [&quot;Cordim&quot;, &quot;Arthritis&quot;]
- Input: &quot;talked about breast cancer treatment&quot; → Extract: [&quot;Breast Cancer&quot;]
- Input: &quot;mentioned neurova 10mg&quot; → Extract: [&quot;Neurova 10mg&quot;]
- Input: &quot;discussed lung cancer and oncuvia&quot; → Extract: [&quot;Lung Cancer&quot;, &quot;Oncuvia&quot;]
- Input: &quot;arthritis and diabetes products&quot; → Extract: [&quot;Arthritis&quot;, &quot;DIABETES&quot;]

### Product Guidance Integration
When extracting product information, consider incorporating relevant Product Guidance Records:

**For Cordim discussions:**
- Use Cordim Message1-7 for efficacy and safety messaging
- Reference specific benefits like &quot;60% improvement in joint pain&quot; or &quot;once-a-month injection&quot;

**For Immunexis discussions:**
- Use Immunexis Message1-3 for patient support and safety information
- Use Immunexis Objective1-3 for visit objectives and goals

**For Neurology products:**
- Use Neurova-Migraine Message1 for safety profile information
- Use Zentriq-Migraine Message2 for efficacy data

**Integration Guidelines:**
- Include relevant Product Guidance content in `additionalinformation` fields
- Use Product Guidance messaging to enhance `nextprvdvisitobjectives`
- Reference specific benefits and safety data when appropriate
- Maintain accuracy by using exact Product Guidance text

### Activities
- Extract visit activities, discussions, presentations, demonstrations
- Look for action verbs and activity descriptions

### Outcomes
- Extract visit outcomes, decisions, agreements, next steps
- Look for result-oriented language

### Dates
- Extract all dates and times mentioned
- Convert to ISO datetime format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- **IMPORTANT**: If no specific times are mentioned but visit is described as happening, use current date with default times (14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z)
- **IMPORTANT**: For &quot;update visit&quot; scenarios, assume visit happened today with reasonable times

### Locations
- Extract visit locations, addresses, facilities mentioned
- Look for place names, addresses, and location descriptions
- Focus on specific address details for Contact Point Address mapping
- **IMPORTANT**: Only extract if location is explicitly mentioned. Do not generate or assume locations.

## Confidence Scoring
- **0.0-0.3**: Low confidence (uncertain extraction)
- **0.4-0.6**: Medium confidence (some uncertainty)
- **0.7-0.9**: High confidence (clear extraction)
- **1.0**: Complete confidence (exact match)

## Critical Extraction Rules

### Multiple Product Handling
When multiple products are mentioned in a single sentence (e.g., &quot;Discussed Arthritis and Cordim&quot;):
1. **ALWAYS** create separate entries for each product in `providerVisitProdDetailing`
2. **ALWAYS** include both products in `extractedEntities.products`
3. **NEVER** combine multiple products into a single entry
4. Use proper capitalization for product names

### Status Field Rules
- **NEVER** use &quot;Completed&quot; status
- If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, use &quot;In Progress&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot;
- Default to &quot;Planned&quot; for most visit updates

### Product Message Mapping Rules
- **ALWAYS** compare input content against Product Guidance Records
- **ALWAYS** select the closest matching Product Guidance message for each product discussed
- **ALWAYS** use the selected Product Guidance message in `providerVisitDtlProductMsg.additionalinformation`
- **NEVER** use generic or extracted content when a Product Guidance match exists
- **ALWAYS** create separate `providerVisitDtlProductMsg` entries for each product with its matched message

### Required Field Population
- **ALWAYS** provide realistic timestamps if visit is described as happening
- **ONLY** provide contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **ALWAYS** populate account information if provider is mentioned

### Timestamp Population Rules
- **If visit is described as &quot;completed&quot;, &quot;finished&quot;, or &quot;done&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times (e.g., 14:00-14:45)
- **If visit is described as &quot;in progress&quot; or &quot;ongoing&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;scheduled&quot; or &quot;planned&quot;**: Use current date or next business day with reasonable times
- **If visit is described as &quot;update visit&quot;**: Use current date with reasonable times
- **Default time range**: 14:00:00Z to 14:45:00Z (45-minute visit)
- **Use null only if**: Visit is clearly not scheduled or is cancelled

### Contact Point Address Rules
- **DO NOT generate addresses**: Only extract if explicitly mentioned in the notes
- **DO NOT assume locations**: Do not create fictional addresses or locations
- **DO NOT use provider names as addresses**: Provider name ≠ location
- **Use empty string**: If no location is mentioned in the voice note
- **Extract only if**: Specific place, address, hospital, clinic, or facility is mentioned

## Important Notes
1. Always return valid JSON
2. Use empty strings for missing optional fields
3. Use null for missing datetime fields
4. Include confidence scores for all extractions
5. Extract all relevant entities mentioned
6. Follow the exact JSON structure provided
7. Convert all dates to ISO format when mentioned
8. Map picklist values to valid options
9. Handle multiple products and discussions appropriately
10. Focus only on data that can be extracted from visit notes
11. Do not include system-generated fields (IDs, territory, account)
12. Use productname for primary product identification (system will map to Product2 or Life Sciences Marketable Product IDs)
13. Use contactpointaddress for location identification (system will map to Contact Point Address records for Place ID)
14. **CRITICAL**: Extract ALL products mentioned, not just the first one
15. **CRITICAL**: Use proper capitalization for product names
16. **CRITICAL**: Never use &quot;Completed&quot; status
17. **CRITICAL**: Always populate timestamps for visits that are described as happening
18. **CRITICAL**: Use reasonable default times (14:00-14:45) when specific times aren&apos;t mentioned
19. **CRITICAL**: Only extract contact point address if location is explicitly mentioned in the notes
20. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT product names from the comprehensive list provided above
21. **CRITICAL**: Apply fuzzy matching rules for product name variations and partial matches
22. **CRITICAL**: Reference Product Guidance Records when products are mentioned to provide accurate messaging
23. **CRITICAL**: Use Product Guidance content to enhance additionalinformation and nextprvdvisitobjectives fields
24. **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT account names from the comprehensive Account list provided above
25. **CRITICAL**: Apply account name matching rules for variations and partial matches
